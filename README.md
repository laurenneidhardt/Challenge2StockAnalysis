# Challenge2StockAnalysis
Refactoring of AllStocksAnalysis VBA
# Overview of the Project
To make this script more versatile for future use, the macro has been refactored to consume more data and increase performance. Using the array in this manner would make it easy for the user to add more stock tickers and run the data quickly. 

# Results
