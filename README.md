# Challenge2StockAnalysis
Refactoring of AllStocksAnalysis VBA
# Overview of the Project
To make this script more versatile for future use, the macro has been refactored to consume more data and increase performance. Using the array in this manner would make it easy for the user to add more stock tickers and run the data quickly. 

# Results
## 2017 Results:
![VBA_Challenge_2017](https://github.com/laurenneidhardt/Challenge2StockAnalysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2017.PNG)
#### Overall stocks performance was great in 2017 and this refactored script ran faster than in the previous version.
## 2018 Results: 
![VBA_Challenge_2018](https://github.com/laurenneidhardt/Challenge2StockAnalysis/blob/main/VBA_Challenge_2018.PNG)
#### Stocks performed much lower 2018, but a couple of them performed really well. The refactored code ran much faster in this version.
# Summary
  The advantages of refactoring code can be as simple as improving performance and perhaps simplifying it. You can also make it more versatile, making it consume different data than it may have been hardcoded for previously. Disadvantages could be driving down performance or perhaps breaking a working code and having to spend time getting it back to functional.
    The original script was looking at a particular stock ticker and the changes I made allowed it to be broadened to include more data and perform faster.
